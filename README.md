# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs into more manageable and shareable links. Users can register for an account, log in, and then create and manage their shortened URLs. The application provides functionality to edit and delete URLs, as well as view a list of URLs associated with their account. Additionally, TinyApp provides features for user authentication, password hashing to ensure the security of user accounts. It's a practical tool for simplifying long URLs and tracking links in a user-friendly way.
